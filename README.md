# Binscan - Binary scanner for specific signature patterns
A simple scanner that can be used to find predefined patterns in files, memory, or whatever source of data available.

## Notes
This is a work in progress project, there are lots of minor error cases left that should be dealt with, as well as testing it thoroughly with Valgrind.

There are already a couple memory leaks in the code I'm pushing right now, which I'm aware of, but I'm done for the day :^)
